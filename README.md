# Predicting-the-Bulk-Modulus-of-Inorganic-Crystals

We get data from Matminer, expanded with the Magpie feature generator

The project requires implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze the data structure, followed by model selection to optimize prediction performance using various regression techniques, including linear regression, Ridge, Lasso, decision trees, and kernel ridge regression. 

Feature selection methods such as LASSO with LARS and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) are used to identify important features. 

The results should be compiled into a scientific report, structured like a short communication, with sections covering theory, methodology, results, and conclusions. 

Code must adhere to given constraints, use provided functions, and be well-documented.
