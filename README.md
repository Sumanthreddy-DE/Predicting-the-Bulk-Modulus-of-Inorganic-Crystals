# Predicting-the-Bulk-Modulus-of-Inorganic-Crystals

This repository focuses on predicting the bulk modulus of inorganic crystals using machine learning techniques. 

The dataset, sourced from Matminer, has been expanded with the Magpie feature generator. 

The project involves Principal Component Analysis (PCA), linear regression models (Least Squares, Ridge, Lasso), polynomial feature expansion, decision tree regressors, kernel ridge regression, and feature selection techniques (LARS, Recursive Feature Elimination). 

The goal is to find the optimal predictive model by evaluating different approaches based on performance metrics. The implementation adheres to structured coding practices, and all functions are well-documented for clarity.
